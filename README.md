This is a physics-based programme that uses predictions of protein structure generated by the ESMFold API, and improves upon their stability using physics-based methods, chiefly meta-dynamics which attempts to mimic the role of ATP/chaperone proteins in helping proteins reach their lowest-energy conformations.
